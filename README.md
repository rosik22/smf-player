# smf-player
This is a simple music file player for a project. The code will be primarily in python. 

The player has the option to save and open playlists. You may also load folder.
ID3 tag reading is part of its forte along with loading album art covers wherever possible via the LastFM API and it offers 
song recommendations via Spotify's Web API.

More can be said but it's best to try it out. The GUI is written in wxPython.
